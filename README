*** GNU_ASM ***

GNU_ASM is a C command line tool for converting  Microsoft-style assembly language
source files into GAS (GNU Assembler) format. It takes a single parameter - the
filename and creates a new .s file in the same directory. The original purpose of
the tool was to speed up porting of my Windows CE ARM asm projects to Android. 
The Raspberry Pi uses the same format, so that is its latest use for me. It has
been tested with a bunch of my projects, but is probably missing some feature that
someone uses and I haven't. It converts keywords, label style and comments in a
non-destructive way. If it can't get your project 100% converted, it should at
least get you 99% of the way there and save you a lot of time in the process.

I started this several years ago for WinCE and recently needed it again for some
Raspberry Pi projects, and this inspired me to release it as open source. Feel
free to email me if you have any questions/bugs/suggestions.
